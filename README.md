This project explores key machine learning techniques using R, including:

- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks**

It consists of two main applications:

1. **Unsupervised Clustering** of vehicle characteristics using PCA and K-Means to identify natural groupings in the data.
2. **Electricity Load Forecasting** using MLP models, incorporating time-delayed inputs for predictive analysis.

The repository includes R code for data preprocessing, outlier removal, normalization, clustering evaluation methods (NbClust, Elbow, Silhouette, Gap Statistic), and multiple MLP model configurations for performance comparison.
